Stated simply, it says any positive integer a can be divided by another positive integer b in such a way that it leaves a remainder r that is smaller than b. Many of you probably recognise this as the usual division process Although this result is easy to state and understand, ithas many applications related to the divisibility properties of integers. We touch upon a few of them, and use it mainly to compute the HCF of two positive integers. long quitel"

You already know that every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way this important fact is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state and understand, it has some very and significant applications in the field ofmathematics We use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First; we use it to prove the irrationality of) ofthe numbers you studied in Class IX, such as V2, V3 and V5 Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimal expansion of a rational number, say is terminating and when it is non- terminating repeating: We do so by looking at the prime factorisation ofthe denominator p You will see that the prime factorisation of q will completely reveal the nature of the decimal expansion of p deep many E(q + 0) _ q of"
